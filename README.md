# DeepLearning Apps
- After understanding the methodology in full stack development and web applications, 
I decided to take my experience with Artificial intelligence one step further. Using the power of mathematics and neural networks, I will be able to build secure/fast Deep learning AI projects.

## Project wireframing
- the goal of models is to use basic mathematical concepts in Data Science. For example, with Sigmoid Function, Regression is better determined to find out confidence.
- K-NN (Kth nearest neighbor) Algorithm is used to quickly find confidence for project in Fitness App

## Feature Object/image recognition/text recognition locations:
- Here is a Interactive Web Application that is a social media platform called Gwitr. The Web Applications using Html, Css, Javascript, but
uses Java to provide features such as bcrypt for strong security. More info can be found by clicking this link: 
[Web App](gwitr/Readme.md)
- A big issue in social media is that some social media don't feel inclusive, and profanity or negative comments are used. With this inclusive WebApp,
I solve it by using Machine learning to avoid bad language and invite anyone with the proper news of the day! 
- Post and reply to anyone's feed!

## Feature Pose Recognizer :
- In this project, I built a Android application that will recognize excercises and find out correct form as it is one of the major issues in fitness - Health and Safety.
- To prevent injuries this app saves money and help those who prefer not to use a personal trainer. Futher, this app helps build on knowledge, count the reps, enouraging quotes, schedule a Monthly/Weekly/Daily workout plan and goals, and guide form.

## Feature Cravings Finder Smart App
- In this project, we use ML to find the nearest restaurant with the ingredients snapshotted!
- Stretch goal: Find recipe's based on ingredients.
